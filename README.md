# unit-4-game

This is a calculator-like game writen in jQuery.

`Math.floor` and `Math.random` are used to generate random numbers.

`.includes` and `.indexOf` are used to check if a number or string is already in an array.

Functions are used to minimize the repeat of codes.

“Click” events are added to pictures to enable the game.

Texts are added to record wins and losses and make the game more fun!
